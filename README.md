# Python Scripts and Exercises Repository

Welcome to my Python repository, where I will be uploading scripts and exercises related to various topics in computer science and data science. This repository is a collection of my work as I explore different areas of programming and machine learning.

## Topics Covered

1. **Concurrency**: Scripts showcasing techniques for parallel and asynchronous programming, including multithreading, multiprocessing, and async/await patterns in Python.
2. **Deep Learning**: Implementations of deep learning models using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, covering concepts like neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and more.
3. **Unsupervised Learning**: Exercises and examples of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and other unsupervised learning techniques, focusing on algorithms like K-means, PCA, t-SNE, and autoencoders.
4. **Numerical Methods**: Python programs solving mathematical and engineering problems using numerical techniques such as integration, differentiation, and solving linear/non-linear systems.
5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Scripts demonstrating OOP principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and the use of design patterns in Python.
6. **Supervised Learning**: Exercises implementing classification, regression, and other supervised learning models, such as decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the different folders for each topic, where you will find scripts, notebooks, and other resources. The repository is constantly being updated as I complete more exercises and projects.
